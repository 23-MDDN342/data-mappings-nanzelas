## 2024 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings

part1:I created two sketches to improve on the face from my project two

part2:When I was mapping, It's adjusted visually according to the actual position of the features on a person's face. I decided to use sliders to control the spacing of the eyes, the position of the nose, how far the mouth opens and closes, the colour of the face and the presence or absence of hair

part3:I found out through training that there was a mistake in the opening and closing of the mouth. I mapped mouths with different degrees of opening and closing with the difference being more pronounced and trained multiple times to ensure it had a pronounced degree of opening and closing.
