## 2024 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings

part1:I created two sketches to improve on the face from my project two, I don't think the original face would have rendered too well visually in this project. So I added some visual details to the original by fitting the shape more to the face for the next training attributes.

part2:When I was mapping, It's adjusted visually according to the actual position of the features on a person's face. I made minor adjustments to the mapping of the face by looking at the face anchor points to get a more accurate positioning by calculating the spacing of the features. I decided to use sliders to control the spacing of the eyes, the position of the nose, how far the mouth opens and closes, the colour of the face and the presence or absence of hair

part3:I found out through training that there was a mistake in the opening and closing of the mouth. I mapped mouths with different degrees of opening and closing with the difference being more pronounced and trained multiple times to ensure it had a pronounced degree of opening and closing.

Finalï¼šThis project is an AI training model developed by for the face of project two. My original intention was to create a minimalist style emoticon to be used in life. So in my mapping image I have chosen face images from various scenes. I learnt more about machine learning in my project and mapped my face better with more technical code. The slider control is more clever to make him fit more application scenarios with real faces. I also learnt about the mapping relationships of face coordinates in the code and how to better map to the mask by adjusting the range of values. I ventured into mapping the faces of comic book characters in which I thought emojis shouldn't only appear in the real world. In the end, my project implemented the ability to capture face anchors via ai as well as change mask styles based on face details in real time via the camera.
